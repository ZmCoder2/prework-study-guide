        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.</li>
          <li>HTML uses markup to describe and create the structure of web pages.</li>
          <li>All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration. The HTML document type should look like the following: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;.</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
          <li>The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.</li>
          <li>Must only appear once, at the top of the web page (before any HTML tags).</li>
          <li>Also, it is not case-sensitve because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensistve.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The structure of HTML is built up by elements and represented by tags.</li>
</ul>
          <h4>HTML Elements:</h4>
          <ul>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements are a type of content on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The following are types of elements that are commonly used to add content to web pages: Text elements, Image elements, Header elements, and List elements.</li>
          <li>The &lt;head&gt; element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser render the page correctly. Elements that are within the &lt;head&gt; are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The &lt;body&gt; element represents and contains the visible content shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to and interact with must be place inside this element.</li>
          <li>Inside the &lt;head&gt; element, we can use the following metadata tags:</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
            <li>The &lt;title&gt; element specifies a title for a webpage. This element is required and is extemely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
          <li>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as Google or Bing. Better SEO results in your website more frequently showing up in searches.</li>
          </ul>  
            <li>The &lt;style&gt; element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
            <li>The &lt;base&gt; element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
            <li>The &lt;link&gt; element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
            <li>The &lt;meta&gt; element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewpoint. Below, are some examples:</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
            <li>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;. The &lt;meta&gt; element defines the charset, or character set, as UTF-8, which allows us to use most characters and symbols on the page.</li>
            <li>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt;. The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
            <li>&lt;meta name="vieport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;. The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          </ul>  
            <li>The &lt;script&gt; element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
            <li>The &lt;p&gt; element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
            <li>You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of your text on your webpages.</li>
          </ul>

          </ul>

          <li>HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other documents) and all HTML consist of nested HTML elements. They are called child elements.</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
          <li>If there are three elements nested inside of a &lt;body&gt; element, those three nested elements are known as child elements.</li>
        </ul>
          <li>The element that holds all the children-in the previous case, the &lt;body&gt; element-is known as the parent element.</li>
          <li>The "parent/child" language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
          <li>Elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to broswers and other developers.</li>
          <li>Below, are some common element types that are used to divide and describe a page:</li> 
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">  
          <li>Meta-related elements</li> 
          <li>Content division elements</li>
          <li>Semantic elements.</li> 
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
            <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the elements describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
            <li>When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make our HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</li>
            <li>Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li> 
          </ul>
          <li>Not all elements are semantic, though. It is common to see non-semantic elements such as &lt;div&gt; to create a division in the page or &lt;span&gt; to create an inline division.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
 <h4>HTML Tags:</h4>
          <ul>
          <li>Tags label pieces of content; Heading, Paragraph, and Table.</li>
          <li>Tags usually come in pairs: a start tag and the end tag.</li>
          <li>A start tag begins a section of a web page. It should look like the following:</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>&lt;Tagname&gt;</li>
          </ul>
          <li>An end tag is writen just like the start tag but with a forward slash (/) inserted before the tag name. It should look like the following:</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>&lt;/Tagname&gt;</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Now, for how a start tag and end tag should look together; &lt;Starttag&gt;content goes here&lt;/Endtag&gt;</li>
          <li>The &lt;html&gt; tag represents the root, or start element of any HTML document.</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
          <li>You can put what is called an HTML attribute inside the &lt;html&gt; tag that defines additional information about an element and they are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>For example; &lt;html lang="en"&gt;. Inside the &lt;html&gt; tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage (in the example, en for English).</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; tags are used to define HTML headings.</li>
          <li>&lt;h1&gt; defines the most important heading. &lt;h6&gt; defines the least important heading.</li>
          <li>Only use one &lt;h1&gt; per page and this should represent the main heading/subject for the whole page.</li>
          <li>Also, do not skip heading levels - start with &lt;h1&gt;, then use &lt;h2&gt;, and so on.</li>


        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
          <li>CSS is used to add style to a webpage.</li>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS defines color, aesthetics, visual layout, and orginization.</li>
          <li>We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS:</li>  
          <ol type="1">
              <li>Inline CSS</li>
              <li>Internal CSS Style Sheet</li>
              <li>External CSS Style Sheet</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>    
        <h4>Inline CSS:</h4>
          <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS is when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>They are useful for quick and permenant changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>Example of Inline CSS is using the style attribute to change the color of a single h1 heading:</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
          <li>&lt;h1 style="color:red;"&gt;Inline CSS Example&lt;/h1&gt;</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>Internal Style Sheet:</h4>
          <ul>
          <li>Internal Style Sheets contain CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
          <li>The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and ID's, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
        </ul>
          </ul>
          <ul>
          <li>The following code shows what an Internal CSS Style Sheet should look along the lines like:</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li>&lt;head&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;style&gt;</li>
        <ul>h1 {</ul>
        <ul>color:red;</ul>
        <ul>}</ul>
        <li>&lt;/style&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;/head&gt;</li>
          </ul>
          <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
          <li>The preceding CSS states that all &lt;h1&gt; elements on the webpage will be red.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Inline CSS and Internal Style Sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an External CSS Style Sheet.</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>External CSS Style Sheet:</h4>
          <ul>
          <li>External CSS Style Sheets are preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>When using an External Style Sheet, we link the file using a &lt;link&gt; element placed in the HTML's &lt;head&gt;, as shown in the following code:</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li>&lt;head&gt;</li>
            <ul>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css"/&gt;</ul>
          <li>&lt;/head&gt;</li>
          </ul>
          </ul>
        <h4>CSS Rule:</h4>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li>div {color: blue; text-align: justify;}</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
          <li>div is the selector.</li>
          <li>color: and text-align: are the properties.</li>
          <li>blue; and justify; are the values.</li>
          <li>{color: blue; and text-align: justify;} are the declarations.</li>
          <li>{color: blue; text-align: justify;} is the declaration block.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Example:</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li>.card {</li>
            <ul>width: 80%;</ul>
            <ul>margin: 40px auto;</ul>
            <ul>border: 5px solid gray;</ul>
            <ul>box-shadow: 5px 10px #888888;</ul>
          <li>}</li>
          </ul>
          <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>The first declaration addresses the width of the element at 80% of the available width.</li>
          <li>The margin property assigns 40px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right.</li>
          <li>The border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an elements frame.</li>
          </ul>
          </ul>
      </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>Git is the most commonly used version control software among developers and a tool that you will likely use on the job.</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Version control systems/softwares allows us to track and manage changes to our codebase. That way, if we need to make changes or even revert back to an earlier copy, we can do without losing other versions of our code.</li>
          <li>Every time we save a version of our work using version control, it is assigned a unique identifier called an SHA, or hash, that allows us to keep a record of the specific changes committed.</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>This unique identifier provides a reference to that specific version of code so we can retrieve it as needed.</li>
            <li>An SHA, or hash, is actually a long string of numbers or letters, like this: "e0eaed45609ae40ada29664384e679ada5d5004a". However, when using the SHA to access a version of their code, developers often type out only the first seven numbers or letters. This gives just the right amount of information to allow the right version to be retrieved and eliminates the need to copy the entire SHA.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
          <li>To access Git, we use the command line in terminal.</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
          <li>Using Git commands, we can initiate or create a repo (repository), add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>

          <li>git log --stat -M: shows all commit logs with indication of any paths that moved.</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>Git Ignoring Patterns: Preventing unintentional staging or committing of files</h4>
          <ul>
          <style>
          ul.no-bullets {
            list-style-type: none;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
          }
          </style>
          <li>logs/</li>
          <ul class="no-bullets">
            <li>*.notes  : saves a file with desired patterns as gitignore with either direct string matches or wildcard globs.</li>
            <li>pattern*/</li>
          </ul>
          <li>git config --global core.excludesfile [file]: system wide ignores pattern for all local repositories.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

          <li>git stash list: lists stack-order of stashed file changes.</li>
          <li>git stash pop: writes working from the top of stash stack.</li>
          <li>git stash drop: discards the changes from the top of stash stack.</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>GitHub</h4>
          <ul>
          <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but in order for you to be able to collaborate with others, you need to use another tool, GitHub.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version control software that lets multiple people make seperate changes to web pages at the same time.</li>
          <li>With GitHub, developers can build code, track changes, and innovate solutions to problems that might arise during the site development process simultaneously.</li>  
          </ul>
        <h4>How to speak GitHub</h4>
          <ul>
          <li>Repository (repo)- a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored.</li>
          <li>Branch- a workspace in which you can make changes that won't affect the live site.</li>
          <li>Markdown (.md)- a way to write in Github that converts plain text to GitHub code. Sites such as Atom and Sublime Text are examples of free resources for developers using Markdown.</li>
