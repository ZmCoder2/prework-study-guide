## Description

This Prework Study Guide Webpage was created to help bootcamp student learn the fundementals of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. 
I built this project to get hands on learning of how to use HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript to prepare myself for when the bootcamp officially starts. 
The problems that this Prework Study Guide Webpage solves is how develop a webpage with having no experience as a Developer or the tools in the past. 
I learned how to create a webpage with HTML programming language to display my notes into the browser in an orderly fashion. I also learned how to use CSS to put style into the webpage. I learned how to push my code into GitHub so other developers would be able to see my code and collaborate with me on if they had any opinions to better my code. With JavaScript I was able to learn how to put interactive designs into my webpage and be able to see my code or topics through Google Chrome Dev.
